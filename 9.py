# Today we discuss about loops
# with a lot of practice questions

# loops are used to repeat instructions

# while loop
count=1
while count<=5:
    print("hello world")
    count+=1
# another example with small variable
i=1
while i<=10:
    print("i am a programmer",i)
    i+=1

 # print numbers from 1 to 5

i=1   
while i<=5:
    print(i)
    i+=1

 # print numbers from 5 to 1
print("Another loop Example")

i=5   
while i>=1:
    print(i)
    i-=1
